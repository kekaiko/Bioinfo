The epiblast (epi) and extraembryonic ectoderm (exe) of embryos were quickly separated by needle.  For WGBS, gDNA was extracted from the embryos (E6.5 and E7.5) by using TIANamp Micro DNA Kit (TIANGEN, Cat#DP316) according to the manufacturer's instructions.","For RNA-seq, the cDNA library experimental procedure was mainly according to reported protocol (Peng et al., 2019, Nature). Sequencing was performed on the Illumina Nova Seq 6000 at the Novogene Bioinformatics Institute, Beijing, China.  For WGBS, the DNA methylation library experimental procedure was mainly modified from previous published method (PMID 28182018; PMID 22649061). After extraction of mouse embryo genomic DNA, 10 ng of DNA was taken as the start material for DNA methylation library preparation. 0.1 ng lambda DNA for each sample was spiked into the sample to quantify the C-to-T conversion efficiency. The bisulfite treatment was performed using EZ-96 DNA Methylation-Direct MagPrep (Zymo cat#D5044) based on user instruction, and the sample was eluted in 19.5 μL H2O. To synthesize the first stand after bisulfite conversion, 2.5 μL 10× Blue buffer (TIANGEN), 2 μL 10 mM dNTP (TAKARA) and 1 μL 100 mM bio-P5-N6-Oligo 1 (/5Biosg/CTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTNNNNNN) were added to the sample and sample was incubated at 65°C for 3 min. Then 1μL Klenow exo–  (TIANGEN) was added and the sample was incubated at 4°C for 5 min, +1°C/15 sec to 37°C, 37°C for 30 min. The random priming was repeated 4 times and the free-primer was removed by treating with Exo I (NEB). The biotin-labelled fragments were enriched using Dynabeads M280 Streptavidin beads (Invitrogen) with rotation at room temperature for 45 min. The second strand was synthesized using P7-N9-oligo2 (AGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTNNNNNN) and Klenow exo– (TIANGEN).

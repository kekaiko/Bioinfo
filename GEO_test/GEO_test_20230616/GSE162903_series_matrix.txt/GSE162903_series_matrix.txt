!Series_summary	"Here, we first establish an easy Multi-Stop system to simultaneously inactivate genes involved in DNA methylation and demethylation in zygotes through introduction of the stop codon by hA3A-eBE-Y130F-mediated base editor (BE). While Multi-Stop-derived Dnmt-null embryos display embryonic lethal due to gastrulation failure. Moreover, mutation combinations between Tet and Dnmt families show severe embryonic lethal and Dnmt1 or Dnmt3a/3b is indispensable for mouse gastrulation. Then WGBS and RNA-seq analysis of different mutant embryos reveals genes jointly maintained by Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a/3b that are critical for gastrulation."
!Series_overall_design	"We used WGBS (Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing) and RNA-seq to analyze the change of DNA methylation and transcription in DNMT and TET mutant embryos. WGBS data of E7.5 whole embryos from eight groups of 32 samples, including E7.5-control, E7.5-Dnmt1-KO, E7.5-Dnmt3a/3b-DKO, E7.5-Dnmt1/3a/3b-TKO, E7.5-Tet1/2/3;Dnmt1/3a/3b-6KO, E7.5-Tet1/2/3; Dnmt3a/3b-5KO, E7.5-Tet1/2/3; Dnmt1-4KO, E7.5-Tet1/2; Dnmt3a/3b-4KO. WGBS data of E6.5 and E7.5 embryo from 16 groups of 48 samples, including Ex-E6.5-control, Ex-E6.5-Dnmt1-KO, Ex-E6.5-Dnmt3a/3b-DKO, Ex-E6.5-Dnmt1/3a/3b-TKO, Em-E6.5-control, Em-E6.5-Dnmt1-KO, Em-E6.5-Dnmt3a/3b-DKO, Em-E6.5-Dnmt1/3a/3b-TKO, Ex-E7.5-control, Ex-E7.5-Dnmt1-KO, Ex-E7.5-Dnmt3a/3b-DKO, Ex-E7.5-Dnmt1/3a/3b-TKO, Em-E7.5-control, Em-E7.5-Dnmt1-KO, Em-E7.5-Dnmt3a/3b-DKO, Em-E7.5-Dnmt1/3a/3b-TKO. RNA-seq data of E6.5 and E7.5 embryo from 16 groups of 48 samples, including Ex-E6.5-control, Ex-E6.5-Dnmt1-KO, Ex-E6.5-Dnmt3a/3b-DKO, Ex-E6.5-Dnmt1/3a/3b-TKO, Em-E6.5-control, Em-E6.5-Dnmt1-KO, Em-E6.5-Dnmt3a/3b-DKO, Em-E6.5-Dnmt1/3a/3b-TKO, Ex-E7.5-control, Ex-E7.5-Dnmt1-KO, Ex-E7.5-Dnmt3a/3b-DKO, Ex-E7.5-Dnmt1/3a/3b-TKO, Em-E7.5-control, Em-E7.5-Dnmt1-KO, Em-E7.5-Dnmt3a/3b-DKO, Em-E7.5-Dnmt1/3a/3b-TKO."

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1	"For RNA-seq, the cDNA library experimental procedure was mainly according to reported protocol (Peng et al., 2019, Nature). Sequencing was performed on the Illumina Nova Seq 6000 at the Novogene Bioinformatics Institute, Beijing, China.  For WGBS, the DNA methylation library experimental procedure was mainly modified from previous published method (PMID 28182018; PMID 22649061). After extraction of mouse embryo genomic DNA, 10 ng of DNA was taken as the start material for DNA methylation library preparation. 0.1 ng lambda DNA for each sample was spiked into the sample to quantify the C-to-T conversion efficiency. The bisulfite treatment was performed using EZ-96 DNA Methylation-Direct MagPrep (Zymo cat#D5044) based on user instruction, and the sample was eluted in 19.5 μL H2O. To synthesize the first stand after bisulfite conversion, 2.5 μL 10× Blue buffer (TIANGEN), 2 μL 10 mM dNTP (TAKARA) and 1 μL 100 mM bio-P5-N6-Oligo 1 (/5Biosg/CTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTNNNNNN) were added to the sample and sample was incubated at 65°C for 3 min. Then 1μL Klenow exo–  (TIANGEN) was added and the sample was incubated at 4°C for 5 min, +1°C/15 sec to 37°C, 37°C for 30 min. The random priming was repeated 4 times and the free-primer was removed by treating with Exo I (NEB). The biotin-labelled fragments were enriched using Dynabeads M280 Streptavidin beads (Invitrogen) with rotation at room temperature for 45 min. The second strand was synthesized using P7-N9-oligo2 (AGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTNNNNNN) and Klenow exo– (TIANGEN). The final PCR was performed using NEB pre-indexed primer, universal primer, and KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPA) for 5 cycles. 300-800 bp PCR production was isolated using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.

The bisulfite treatment was performed using EZ-96 DNA Methylation-Direct MagPrep (Zymo cat#D5044) based on user instruction, and the sample was eluted in 19.5 μL H2O.

The random priming was repeated 4 times and the free-primer was removed by treating with Exo I (NEB). The biotin-labelled fragments were enriched using Dynabeads M280 Streptavidin beads (Invitrogen) with rotation at room temperature for 45 min. The second strand was synthesized using P7-N9-oligo2 (AGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTNNNNNN) and Klenow exo– (TIANGEN). The final PCR was performed using NEB pre-indexed primer, universal primer, and KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPA) for 5 cycles. 300-800 bp PCR production was isolated using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.

The bisulfite treatment was performed using EZ-96 DNA Methylation-Direct MagPrep (Zymo cat#D5044) based on user instruction, and the sample was eluted in 19.5 μL H2O.

The random priming was repeated 4 times and the free-primer was removed by treating with Exo I (NEB). The biotin-labelled fragments were enriched using Dynabeads M280 Streptavidin beads (Invitrogen) with rotation at room temperature for 45 min. The second strand was synthesized using P7-N9-oligo2 (AGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTNNNNNN) and Klenow exo– (TIANGEN). The final PCR was performed using NEB pre-indexed primer, universal primer, and KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPA) for 5 cycles. 300-800 bp PCR production was isolated using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.

The bisulfite treatment was performed using EZ-96 DNA Methylation-Direct MagPrep (Zymo cat#D5044) based on user instruction, and the sample was eluted in 19.5 μL H2O.

The random priming was repeated 4 times and the free-primer was removed by treating with Exo I (NEB). The biotin-labelled fragments were enriched using Dynabeads M280 Streptavidin beads (Invitrogen) with rotation at room temperature for 45 min. The second strand was synthesized using P7-N9-oligo2 (AGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTNNNNNN) and Klenow exo– (TIANGEN). The final PCR was performed using NEB pre-indexed primer, universal primer, and KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPA) for 5 cycles. 300-800 bp PCR production was isolated using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.

For WGBS, the DNA methylation library experimental procedure was mainly modified from previous published method (PMID 28182018; PMID 22649061). After extraction of mouse embryo genomic DNA, 10 ng of DNA was taken as the start material for DNA methylation library preparation. 0.1 ng lambda DNA for each sample was spiked into the sample to quantify the C-to-T conversion efficiency.

Bed format methylation files were generated by local scripts and BigWig files used in IGV were generated by UCSC binary tools bedGraphToBigWig(v4)."	"For WGBS, trim_galore(v0.6.4) were used to remove low quality reads and adaptor sequence. Reads pass quality control were mapped to mm10 mouse genome using BitMapperBS(v1.0.2.2) in pair-end mode with parameters ""--sensitive --pbat --unmapped_out"" at first. Unmapped reads were output by samtools(v1.11) and mapped again using BitMapperBS's single-end mode. Aligned bam files were merged and sorted by samtools and the methylation information in MethylKit and bedGraph format were extracted by MethylDackel(v0.4.0) with default parameters. Bed format methylation files were generated by local scripts and BigWig files used in IGV were generated by UCSC binary tools bedGraphToBigWig(v4)."
